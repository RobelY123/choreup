### About ChoreUp
**ChoreUp** was created as commonly we find ourselves doing chores with great amounts of boredom and very little reward. **ChoreUp** helps you create and join groups so that you can feel more purpose and excitement to completing otherwise boring and required activities. Account creation, customizable prizes, groups, and creating your own groups leads to a very satisfying and unique user experience.

### Core features
In **ChoreUp**, you can join groups using codes or you can create your own group. In this group, the owner can create new chores that users can claim for use. The process for submitting a chore as finished is quite simple, as all the user has to do is upload a description and a photo of the completed activity. The admin can then approve or decline whether the activity appears to be completed, and successful completions reward the user with the amount of points as indicated on the chore. These points can then be used to purchase various items that the admin can also put in the group store.
### How we built it
**ChoreUp** was built using **GitHub** for collaboration, mainly **React Native** for language, **Google Firebase** for online database, and **Expo Go** to test our application on mobile devices. 

### Challenges we ran into
A great challenge was connecting the application to **Firebase**. Many hours of the first day were spent figuring out how internet connections and validation were to be implemented. But eventually, we were able to figure it out.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
Finally connecting **Firebase** was a great accomplishment, as if we didn't persevere then we would have to make our application local, instead of online.

### What we learned
As a team, we learned more about communication and collaboration. This was one of our first times using **React Native** specifically, as we usually use just **React JS** for non-mobile applications.
